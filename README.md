# Leave-approval

This is the JSP + JDBC implementation for a leave approval system.

## Types of Users:
1. Manager
2. Employee

Both types of users can register and login to access the system.

## Manager Roles:
1. Approve/Reject new user creation
2. View details of all users
3. Approve/Reject leave requests

## Employee Roles:
1. Make a new leave request
2. View past leave requests
